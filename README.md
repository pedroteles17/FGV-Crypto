# Introduction

This repository was created to store the codes needed to replicate the results from the work submitted to the FGV Crypto competition. The files 'get_reddit_data.py' and 'nlp_analysis.py' tend to take a long time to run (~1 day). 

# Order

Run the codes in the following order:

1. get_reddit_data.py
2. nlp_analyis.py (will generate the 'reddit_sent_analysis.csv' file)
3. markov_portfolio.R
